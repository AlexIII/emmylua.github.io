1. [Remove] Remove attach debugger. Since it blocked by some anti-virus software :-(
    EmmyLua providers attach debugger feature, which should inject .dll file into target application process. but it is getting blocked by the anti-virus software, I once explained https://github.com/EmmyLua/IntelliJ-EmmyLua/issues/263, I had to remove this feature.
